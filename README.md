#Two Dimensional
This is a basic shooter game made for Ludum Dare 29. The theme was "Beneath the Surface", so there is a underlying function of this game which is revealed to the user via email.

The game has distinct rounds in which the player must collection diamonds to open a portal to the next round.

I plan on splitting this game off into a game without rounds and include power-ups, etc.

It was made using the Phaser javascript library.

1. transition menu with feedback [done]
